在美国，学院和大学应为太过于精英化和太昂贵而被批评，并且并没有为世界上的工作训练毕业生。这些评论忽视来这个事实，这些机构继续去培养学生在他们的工作中成功、在生活中思考得到、终身学习、理解世界和他们想要成为什么人。

这些学院和大学必须做一些正确的事。申请人数创下纪录，并且他们的金融项目使得他们比起之前更容易进入。这种教育模式在创造机会、经济增长和持续创新发挥着巨大作用。

然而，这种模式的价值近来受到质疑。最近的税收账单是一种提醒，由于一些政府我们的最有实力的院校受到影响。开始的目的将会使得教育对于许多通过税收的那些毕业生变得难以承受。幸而，这些举措将会从账单中消失。但是法律制定者坚持一个新税收在一些院校的收入投资上。

然而这些攻击是在缺乏引导思想下执行的，我们需要一个更好的行动去解释为什么这些推断是错误的并且为什么我们做的事有价值的。我们不能够带走任何明显的奖励。

经常谈起，精英院校不锻炼学生，尤其是那些学习文学艺术的。但是这可以通过学术研究推翻。数据事清晰的：一个文学艺术教育事巨大的职业经历准备，等同于精彩的生命获得和工作满足感。这是发展批判性思考、数据分析的能力。这项能力保持学生学习。事实上，文学艺术在想象领域尤其重要。

通过在精英院校的学习现在在低中收入家庭中是越来越可以接受的。我们建立了通过校友和理解并接受我们思想的捐赠去提供通道和机会，并且成为金融项目的一个标志性部分。

新的税收为那些不能够负担教育的人提供一个机会。经济背景的多样性加强了所有学生的教育和经历。
